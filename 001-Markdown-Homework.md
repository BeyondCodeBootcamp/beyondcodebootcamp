# First Web Page in Markdown Homework

Your homework is to use Markdown to create a shareable Markdown Cheat Sheet that you will use to teach someone else.

To help I've created a [template](001-Markdown-Homework-Template.png) that you should follow. This cheat sheet is to help _you_. It will also make for a nice portfolio item.

Create a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com) web page with the following:

1. A file named something similar to `Markdown-Cheatsheet.md`
2. A large header with your web page's title
3. A background image that looks at least somewhat related
    - try a Google Image search for "markdown background"
    - to get the URL of an image:
        - (on Mac) use a two-finger click on the image
        - (on Windows) right click on the image
        - select `Copy Image Address`
4. A blockquote with a 1-3 sentence description of Markdown, in your own words
5. A TL;DR section with a quick reference table
6. A few other sections (perhaps about lists or text formatting or links, etc)

Once you've completed your cheat sheet, make sure that your Gist is public (or click the `Make Public` button) and then share a link to your Markdown cheat sheet with someone you already know - a friend, parent, sibling, co-worker, whoever.

The goal is to see if they can understand it.

In interviews you will be asked to explain how you arrived at solutions and why you made the choices that you did.
By practicing your communication in comfortable environments, you are preparing with similar skills.

Believe it or not, having completed the primary homework assignment, you're actually more qualified in Markdown that most software developers. By using it several times in this course, you’ll truly be an expert.

## Example of Content

Your cheat sheet should have content that is similar to these:

Here are a few resources that I recommend you use to get inspiration:

- Markdown Guide:
    - https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
- Github Mastering Markdown:
    - https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf
- Adam P’s Markdown Cheat Sheet:
    - https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

## Extra Resources for Learning

- CommonMark **Interactive** Tutorial:

- Github Mastering Markdown:

## Helpful Markdown Tools

And although you should save your file to gist.github.com, there are 3 other Markdown editors I can recommend for editing markdown with a live preview:

- Stack Edit:
    - https://stackedit.io/app#
- VSCode
    - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview
- Dropbox Paper
    - https://www.dropbox.com/paper

# Bonus Assignment 1

Participate on Stack Overflow.

1. Go to Stackoverflow.com
2. Search for "Github Markdown"
3. Sort by Newest
4. Participate
    - Option A: Take the role of a Markdown expert
        - click through several questions and try to find a question that you can answer - which may require doing more research
        - since the questions people are asking may be too complex or too vague, or there may not be enough questions available to answer, this may not be possible - but try anyway
    - Option B: Ask a question about Markdown
        - Search Stackoverflow to see if there is an answer to your question
        - Your question might be a "stupid question", and someone may even make a rude comment or downvote your question - it doesn't matter, ask anyway
        - Update your Cheat Sheet with the new information

# Bonus Assignment 2

Prepare and Present a 10-minute "lightning talk" at a meetup.

Go on meetup.com
1. Make sure that you have "Group" selected, NOT "Calendar"
2. Search for nearby meetup groups, I'd suggest that you look for:
    - Golang
    - Flutter
    - Rust
    - Julia
    - Linux
    - or just genericly for Developer
3. Contact the host, let them know that you’re new to software and that your mentor suggested that you ask to give a 10 minute lightning talk on Markdown, and ask if they would be willing to let you present (online or in person). You may need to contact multiple hosts.

Note: Markdown is used for documentation for EVERY programming language, so there are VERY MANY people who could benefit from your presentation. Meetups are usually very friendly, and this will actually be a benefit to those attending.
