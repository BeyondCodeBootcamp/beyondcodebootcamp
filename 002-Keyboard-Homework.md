# Homework


- Re-assign the Caps Lock Key to something useful
    - Find "Modifier Keys" in System Preferences and turn off Caps Lock
    - Download and use either `Karabiner Elements` or `Better Touch Tool` to assign it to something useful
        - Esc
        - Enter (return)
        - (something else?)
- Look over the list of [Apple's Official List of Keyboard Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236)
- You will then create a Cheat Sheet with the alt characters and shortcuts that you find most useful
    - **Windows** and **Linux** users, 
    - this MUST include
        - Spotlight Search (or Windows or Linux Search)
        - Screenshots & Screen Recordings (hint: on Mac it's Shift+Cmd+4 and Shift+Cmd+5)
        - Clear Console (hint: it's Cmd+K on Mac, Windows/Linux users will have to google it)
        - The Symbols Keyboard (<kbd>Alt ⌥</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>), take a look at the Technical Symbols (⌘) section.
        - ™
        - ©
        - ≠
    - Find at least 10 other shortcuts and 5 other symbols to include in your cheat sheet.
      (for example: I use •, µ, and ˚ fairly frequently)
