# Homework


- Re-assign the Caps Lock Key to something useful
    - Find "Modifier Keys" in System Preferences and turn off Caps Lock
    - Download and use either `Karabiner Elements` or `Better Touch Tool` to assign it to something useful
- Look over the list of [Apple's Official List of Keyboard Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236)
- You will then create a Cheat Sheet with the alt characters and shortcuts that you find most useful
    - this MUST include
        - Shift+Cmd+5 for screenshots and screen recordings
        - Cmd+K for clear
        - alt+2 for ™
        - alt+g for ©
        - alt+= for ≠
    - Find at least 10 other shortcuts and 5 other symbols to include in your cheat sheet.
      (for example: I use •, µ, and ˚ fairly frequently)
